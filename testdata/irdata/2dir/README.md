# Experimental 2D-IR: D-silicalite at 210 °C

`silicalite_210C_0ps_2DIR.csv` contains the parallel-polarization detector
signal measured at a waiting time of 0.000 ps. The first row contains the pump
wavenumbers; the first column contains the probe wavenumbers. The remaining
values are the measured difference absorbance.

## Preparation

The source file contains parallel and perpendicular detector blocks; this
example keeps the first (parallel) 128 probe rows. The pump axis is restricted
to 2176–2831 cm⁻¹ to retain the measured positive-frequency region and remove
the mirrored half. No baseline correction, smoothing, or normalization has
been applied. The diagonal bleach is negative in this dataset.
